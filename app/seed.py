Script to seed the database with fake data.

The script creates a session to interact with the database, then creates 50
bands, 10 venues, and 90 concerts, and adds them to the database. The bands
and venues are created with fake data, and the concerts are created by
randomly matching bands and venues with a random date.

The script then commits the changes to the database and closes the session.
